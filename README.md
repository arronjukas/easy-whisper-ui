## üçé Initial macOS Support

Thanks to the incredible contribution from [celerycoloured](https://github.com/celerycoloured), EasyWhisper UI now runs on macOS! 
Check it out on the `releases` page. 

## Features
- Supports translation for 100+ languages.
- Supports batch processing ‚Äî drag in multiple files or select many at once; they transcribe one by one in a queue.
- Installer handles everything for you ‚Äî from downloading dependencies to compiling/optimizing Whisper for your specific hardware.
- Choice of `.txt` files, or `.srt` files with timestamps!
- Drag & drop or use ‚ÄúOpen With‚Äù to load media.
- Automatically converts media to `.mp3` if needed using FFmpeg.
- Dropdown menu to select the model (e.g. `tiny`, `medium-en`, `large-v3`).
- Dropdown to select language (e.g. `en` for English).
- Textbox for additional arguments.
- Automatically downloads the chosen model if missing.
- Shows all output in a console box.
- Opens final transcript in Notepad.


- Fully portable MacOS release!
- Windows Acrylic blur theme!
- Fully C++ implementation ‚Äî no Python!
- Uses Vulkan API for cross-platform GPU acceleration!
- Uses Metal API for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon on MacOS!
- More coming soon!

## Requirements

Windows 10/11:

- AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA Graphics Card with Vulkan support. (Pretty much all GPUs including Integrated)
   - Virtual Machines won't work unless it supports `VulkanSDK` (e.g GPU passthrough)

MacOS:

- All Apple Silicon (M1 M2 M3 M4 etc)

---

## Setup

1. **Download** the latest installer.  
2. **Run** the application.

## Build Steps (For Developers)

Windows:

1. **Install [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools)**  
   ‚Äì Use a kit with a compatible C++ compiler (e.g. MinGW).
2. **Install [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)**  
   ‚Äì Required to build the installer.
3. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui.git
   ```
4. **Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator**  
   ‚Äì Located in the root of the cloned folder.
5. **Use a build kit with a C++ compiler and CMake**
6. **Build the project**  
   ‚Äì Press `Ctrl + B` or click the Build button.
7. Installer and build will be in `build\Installer` and `build\Final` respectively.

MacOS:

Tested on **macOS Sequoia (15)**.

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install required tools**
   ```bash
   brew install git gh cmake qt6
   ```
3. **Authenticate GitHub CLI** (optional)
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
4. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui.git
   cd easy-whisper-ui
   ```
5. **Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator** or build with CMake
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt6)
   cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ```
6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   open build/EasyWhisperUI.app
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- If CMake cannot locate Qt, ensure `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` points to the Homebrew Qt directory (`$(brew --prefix qt6)`).
- On first launch macOS may block the app. Right-click the bundle, choose **Open**, and approve the prompt.
- To view logs, run the app from Terminal so any errors appear in the console.
